# VOISSS SocialFi Platform Development Roadmap

## Vision
Transform VOISSS into a SocialFi platform where users record candid, permission-based audio conversations exploring diverse perspectives on curated social topics. Users complete missions (e.g., "ask your driver what they think about Web3"), upload responses as short clips, and participate in a creator economy through minting and curation rewards.

## Phase 1: Mission System & Content Curation (2-3 weeks)

### 1.1 Mission Framework
**New Components to Build:**
- `MissionBoard.tsx` - Display active missions with topics and rewards
- `MissionCard.tsx` - Individual mission display with acceptance flow
- `MissionProgress.tsx` - Track user's active missions and completion status
- `TopicCurator.tsx` - Admin interface for creating and managing topics

**Database Schema Extensions:**
```typescript
// Add to types.ts
export const MissionSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  title: z.string(),
  description: z.string(),
  topic: z.string(), // "crypto", "gender-roles", "marriage", etc.
  difficulty: z.enum(['easy', 'medium', 'hard']),
  reward: z.number(), // STRK tokens
  expiresAt: z.date(),
  maxParticipants: z.number().optional(),
  currentParticipants: z.number(),
  isActive: z.boolean(),
  createdBy: z.string(), // curator address
  tags: z.array(z.string()),
  locationBased: z.boolean(), // true for taxi/local missions
  targetDuration: z.number(), // suggested clip length in seconds
});

export const MissionResponseSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  missionId: z.string(),
  userId: z.string(),
  recordingId: z.string(),
  location: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
    country: z.string(),
    coordinates: z.object({
      lat: z.number(),
      lng: z.number(),
    }).optional(),
  }),
  context: z.string(), // "taxi", "coffee shop", "street interview", etc.
  participantConsent: z.boolean(),
  isAnonymized: z.boolean(),
  submittedAt: z.date(),
  status: z.enum(['pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'featured']),
});
```

**Smart Contract Extensions:**
```cairo
// Add to VoiceStorage contract
struct Mission {
    id: felt252,
    title: ByteArray,
    topic: ByteArray,
    reward: u256,
    expires_at: u64,
    max_participants: u32,
    current_participants: u32,
    is_active: bool,
    creator: ContractAddress,
}

struct MissionResponse {
    mission_id: felt252,
    user_address: ContractAddress,
    recording_hash: ByteArray,
    location_hash: ByteArray, // encrypted location data
