# VOISSS Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Current Status: Foundation Consolidation Complete ✅

**Date**: September 30, 2025
**Status**: Phase 0 complete - shared package established, web migrated, mobile RN partially integrated

---

## ✅ Phase 0: Foundation Consolidation - COMPLETE

### What Was Accomplished
- **✅ Shared Package**: Mission service, recording types, AI interfaces
- **✅ Web Migration**: Full migration to shared services
- **✅ Mobile RN Partial**: Mission service integrated in discover tab
- **✅ Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript with Zod validation
- **✅ Clean Architecture**: Zero platform dependencies in shared

### Core Principles Validated
- **ENHANCEMENT FIRST**: Enhanced existing services instead of rebuilding
- **AGGRESSIVE CONSOLIDATION**: Deleted duplicate code, standardized types
- **DRY**: Single source of truth for all shared logic
- **CLEAN**: Clear separation between business logic and UI

---

## 🚀 Next Priorities (Post-Hackathon)

### Week 1: Complete RN AI Integration
- Add AI service to record tab
- Implement voice transformation UI
- Test end-to-end AI workflow

### Week 2: Flutter Foundation
- Create Dart type models from shared types
- Implement HTTP clients for mission/AI services
- Basic mission and recording UI

### Week 3: RevenueCat Launch
- SDK integration across all platforms
- Subscription flow implementation
- Feature gating logic (Free/Premium/Web3/Ultimate)
