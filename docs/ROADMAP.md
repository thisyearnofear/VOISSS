## 🔧 TECHNICAL DEBT & KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### Current Workarounds (Testnet Phase)

1. **IPFS Hash Storage** (Implemented Oct 15, 2025)
   - **Current**: Deterministic hash stored on-chain (fits felt252), full hash in localStorage
   - **Limitation**: Recordings only visible on device that created them
   - **Mitigation**: Full hash preserved for playback, contract stores proof-of-ownership
   - **Future**: Contract V2 with ByteArray support for full on-chain storage

2. **Cross-Device Sync** (Planned)
   - **Current**: localStorage-based storage per device
   - **Future**: Decentralized metadata service (Ceramic/IPFS) for multi-device access

### Migration Strategy

**Phase 1 (Current - Testnet):**
- ✅ Hash-based contract storage
- ✅ Full hash in localStorage
- ✅ Seamless UX
- ✅ Proof of concept working

**Phase 2 (Mainnet Prep):**
- Deploy Contract V2 with ByteArray
- Test migration scripts
- Parallel operation of both contracts

**Phase 3 (Mainnet):**
- Migrate to Contract V2
- Deprecate hash-based storage
- Full on-chain IPFS hashes
