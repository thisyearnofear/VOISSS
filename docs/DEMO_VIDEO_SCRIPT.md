## üé¨ OPENING (0:00 - 0:30) - The Problem

**[Screen: Show generic voice recording apps with limitations]**

**Script:**
"Content creators face a critical problem: recording, transforming, and sharing voice content across languages requires multiple tools, centralized platforms, and expensive subscriptions.

Traditional solutions are fragmented - you need one app for recording, another for AI transformation, a third for translation, and you're stuck with centralized storage that can disappear overnight.

What if there was a better way?"
