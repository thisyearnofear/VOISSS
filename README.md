## 🎯 The Problem

Current voice recording solutions suffer from several limitations:

- **Poor Organization**: Most apps offer basic chronological lists without meaningful categorization
- **Limited Sharing Options**: Sharing is often an afterthought, not a core feature
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Recording quality varies widely with little user control
- **Fragmented Workflow**: Users need multiple apps for recording, editing, and sharing
- **Uninspiring UX**: Utilitarian interfaces discourage regular use
- **Device Limitations**: Most solutions are device-specific with no cross-platform support
- **No Decentralization**: Centralized platforms control user data and content

## 🚀 Our Solution

VOISSS addresses these challenges through a dual-platform approach:

### 📱 Mobile Apps (React Native + Flutter)

**React Native App (Cross-platform)**

- High-quality audio capture with adjustable parameters
- Tag-based organization system that adapts to your workflow
- Smart search and filtering by content, metadata, or custom tags
- Starknet.js integration for blockchain functionality

**Flutter App (Native performance)**

- Native audio recording with highest quality
- Official starknet.dart SDK integration
- Native mobile wallet connections
- iOS-optimized performance and UI

### 🌐 Decentralised App (Next.js + Starknet)

- Community features for public recordings discovery
- Decentralized storage and ownership of voice recordings
- Creator monetization through Starknet smart contracts
- Cross-platform synchronization and backup

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Architecture

VOISSS is built as a **monorepo** using pnpm workspaces and Turbo for optimal development experience and code sharing across platforms.

### 🏛 Architectural Decision: Monorepo

**Why Monorepo for VOISSS?**

1. **Shared Smart Contract Integration**: Both mobile and web apps interact with the same Starknet contracts, requiring consistent ABIs and types
2. **Hackathon Efficiency**: Single repository submission, unified documentation, and easier judge review
3. **Code Reuse**: Voice recording domain logic, validation rules, and UI components shared across platforms
4. **Consistent Development**: Unified tooling, testing strategies, and deployment pipelines
5. **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript types ensure consistency between mobile and web implementations
6. **Future Scalability**: Easy to extract packages into separate repositories if needed post-hackathon

This architectural choice optimizes for the hackathon timeline while maintaining long-term flexibility and code quality.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**
- **pnpm 8+** (recommended for monorepos)
- **Git** for version control
- **IPFS Provider Account** (Pinata recommended) for real voice functionality

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thisyearnofear/VOISSS.git
cd VOISSS

# Install pnpm globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g pnpm

# Install all dependencies for the monorepo
pnpm install
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# 🌐 Start web app (Next.js)
pnpm dev:web
# Opens http://localhost:3001 ✅ WORKING

# 📱 Start mobile React Native app (Expo)
pnpm dev:mobile
# Shows QR code for Expo Go app ✅ WORKING
# 🔧 IMPORTANT: Uses tunnel mode for Expo Go compatibility
# - Expo Go: Scan QR code (works with tunnel)
# - Web testing: http://localhost:8082 (when 8081 is busy)
# - Simulators: Press 'i' for iOS, 'a' for Android

# 📱 Start mobile Flutter app (Chrome)
pnpm dev:flutter
# Launches in Chrome ✅ WORKING

# 🏗️ Build all apps
pnpm build
# ✅ WORKING

# 🧪 Run tests across all packages
pnpm test

# 🔍 Lint all packages
pnpm lint

# 🧹 Clean all build artifacts
pnpm clean
```

### 🔧 **IPFS Setup (Required for Real Voice Functionality)**

To enable real voice recording and IPFS storage, set up environment variables:

1. **Copy environment template:**

```bash
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
```

2. **Get Pinata API credentials** (recommended):
   - Sign up at [pinata.cloud](https://pinata.cloud)
   - Create API key with pinning permissions
   - Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_PROVIDER=pinata
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_API_SECRET=your_pinata_api_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_GATEWAY_URL=https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/
```

3. **Alternative providers** (Infura, Web3.Storage, local IPFS node) are also supported - see `.env.example` for configuration options.

**Without IPFS setup:** The app will still work but recordings won't be permanently stored.
