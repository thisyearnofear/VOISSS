# VOISSS 🎤

> **Built exclusively for the Starknet Re{ignite} Hackathon**

VOISSS is a next-generation decentralized voice recording platform that transforms how we capture, organize, and share audio content. Built as a comprehensive monorepo solution with **Web dApp**, **Mobile React Native App**, and **Mobile Flutter App** working together to offer users a complete voice recording ecosystem on Starknet.

## 🎯 The Problem

Current voice recording solutions suffer from several limitations:

- **Poor Organization**: Most apps offer basic chronological lists without meaningful categorization
- **Limited Sharing Options**: Sharing is often an afterthought, not a core feature
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Recording quality varies widely with little user control
- **Fragmented Workflow**: Users need multiple apps for recording, editing, and sharing
- **Uninspiring UX**: Utilitarian interfaces discourage regular use
- **Device Limitations**: Most solutions are device-specific with no cross-platform support
- **No Decentralization**: Centralized platforms control user data and content

## 🚀 Our Solution

VOISSS addresses these challenges through a dual-platform approach:

### 📱 Mobile Apps (React Native + Flutter)

**React Native App (Cross-platform)**

- High-quality audio capture with adjustable parameters
- Tag-based organization system that adapts to your workflow
- Smart search and filtering by content, metadata, or custom tags
- Starknet.js integration for blockchain functionality

**Flutter App (Native performance)**

- Native audio recording with highest quality
- Official starknet.dart SDK integration
- Native mobile wallet connections
- iOS-optimized performance and UI

### 🌐 Decentralised App (Next.js + Starknet)

- Community features for public recordings discovery
- Decentralized storage and ownership of voice recordings
- Creator monetization through Starknet smart contracts
- Cross-platform synchronization and backup

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Architecture

VOISSS is built as a **monorepo** using pnpm workspaces and Turbo for optimal development experience and code sharing across platforms.

### 📱 Mobile React Native App (`apps/mobile`)

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo 53
- **Blockchain**: Starknet.js for cross-platform blockchain integration
- **Navigation**: Expo Router for file-based routing
- **Audio**: Expo AV for recording and playback
- **Styling**: NativeWind (Tailwind for React Native)
- **State**: Zustand for state management
- **Dependencies**: `@voisss/shared`, `@voisss/ui`

### 📱 Mobile Flutter App (`apps/mobile-flutter`)

- **Framework**: Flutter 3.10+ with Dart 3.0+
- **Blockchain**: starknet.dart + starknet_flutter for native mobile integration
- **Audio**: record + audioplayers for native audio handling
- **State**: Provider pattern for state management
- **Platform**: iOS-focused (Android post-hackathon)
- **Performance**: Native compilation for optimal mobile performance

### 🌐 Web App (`apps/web`)

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.2 with TypeScript
- **Blockchain**: Starknet.js + Starknet React for web integration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Build**: Turbopack for fast development
- **State**: React Context + Zustand

### 📦 Shared Packages

- **`@voisss/shared`**: Common types, utilities, constants, and business logic
- **`@voisss/contracts`**: Starknet smart contracts written in Cairo
- **`@voisss/ui`**: Cross-platform React components and design system

### 🏛 Architectural Decision: Monorepo

**Why Monorepo for VOISSS?**

1. **Shared Smart Contract Integration**: Both mobile and web apps interact with the same Starknet contracts, requiring consistent ABIs and types
2. **Hackathon Efficiency**: Single repository submission, unified documentation, and easier judge review
3. **Code Reuse**: Voice recording domain logic, validation rules, and UI components shared across platforms
4. **Consistent Development**: Unified tooling, testing strategies, and deployment pipelines
5. **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript types ensure consistency between mobile and web implementations
6. **Future Scalability**: Easy to extract packages into separate repositories if needed post-hackathon

This architectural choice optimizes for the hackathon timeline while maintaining long-term flexibility and code quality.
