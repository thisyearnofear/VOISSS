### 4. Enhanced Main Page
**Updates Made:**
- Added prominent SocialFi missions call-to-action
- Navigation between recording studio and missions
- Smooth scrolling and improved user flow
- Clear value proposition for the new features

## ðŸš€ Immediate Next Steps (Week 1-2)

### 1. Build & Test Current Implementation
```bash
# Build shared packages
cd packages/shared
pnpm build

# Start web app and test missions page
cd apps/web
pnpm dev

# Navigate to http://localhost:4444/missions
```

### 2. Integrate Mission Context into Recording Flow
**Files to Modify:**
- `apps/web/src/components/StarknetRecordingStudio.tsx`
- Add mission selection state
- Include mission context in recording metadata
- Show mission requirements during recording

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Add to recording metadata
interface MissionRecording extends Recording {
  missionId?: string;
  missionContext?: {
    title: string;
    targetDuration: number;
    examples: string[];
    contextSuggestions: string[];
  };
}
```

### 3. Consent Collection System
**New Components to Build:**
- `ConsentFlow.tsx` - Multi-step consent collection
- `ParticipantVerification.tsx` - Verify consent from recorded parties
- `PrivacySettings.tsx` - User privacy preferences

**Key Features:**
- Pre-recording consent scripts
- Post-recording consent confirmation
- Voice obfuscation options (pitch shift, robotic filter)
- Participant identity verification (optional)

### 4. Location Integration
**Implementation:**
- Add geolocation API integration
- Location-based mission filtering
- Privacy controls for location data
- City/country tagging for recordings

## ðŸŽ¨ Medium Term Goals (Week 3-6)

### 1. Curation Tools
**Components to Build:**
- `CurationStudio.tsx` - Drag-and-drop highlight reel creation
- `AudioEditor.tsx` - Basic editing tools (trim, fade, normalize)
- `RewardCalculator.tsx` - Show potential earnings
- `CollectionManager.tsx` - Manage themed collections

### 2. Zora Coins SDK Integration
**Services to Build:**
```typescript
export class ZoraCoinService {
  async createCoin(metadata: CoinMetadata): Promise<string>
  async mintToContributors(coinId: string, contributors: Address[]): Promise<void>
  async createHighlightReel(recordings: Recording[]): Promise<HighlightReel>
  async distributeRewards(coinId: string, splits: RewardSplit[]): Promise<void>
}
```

### 3. Social Features
**Components to Build:**
- `DiscoveryFeed.tsx` - Trending topics and featured content
- `CreatorProfiles.tsx` - User profiles with stats and collections
- `SocialGraph.tsx` - Follow creators, curators, and topics
- `CommentSystem.tsx` - Comments and reactions on recordings

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture Decisions

### 1. Mission Service Pattern
- **Local Storage**: User missions and progress
- **Starknet**: Mission metadata and rewards
- **IPFS**: Mission response recordings
- **Hybrid Approach**: Best of centralized UX with decentralized ownership

### 2. Reward Distribution
- **Creator Share**: 70% of individual recording rewards
- **Curator Share**: 40% of highlight reel rewards
- **Platform Share**: 30% individual, 10% curated
- **Contributors**: 50% of curated content rewards

### 3. Privacy Framework
- **Consent Levels**: Verbal, written, digital signatures
- **Voice Obfuscation**: Real-time pitch shifting and filtering
- **Data Retention**: User-configurable retention periods
- **Revocation Rights**: Participants can revoke consent

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics to Track

### User Engagement
- Daily active missions completed
- Average recording length and quality
- User retention and repeat participation
- Geographic distribution of content

### Creator Economy
- Total value minted through platform
- Creator earnings distribution
- Curation success rates
- Platform fee sustainability

### Content Quality
- Community rating scores
- Transcription accuracy
- Topic diversity and depth
- Cultural insight generation

## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Preparation

### For Hackathon Judges
1. **Mission Discovery**: Show mission board with filtering
2. **Mission Acceptance**: Demonstrate wallet connection and acceptance flow
3. **Recording with Context**: Record a sample conversation with mission context
4. **Reward System**: Show STRK token rewards and distribution
5. **Privacy Features**: Demonstrate consent collection and voice obfuscation

### Key Talking Points
